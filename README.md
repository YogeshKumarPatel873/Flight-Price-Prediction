## Introduction

Air travel is an integral part of modern life, and the fluctuating prices of airline tickets can be a source of frustration for travelers. This project aims to address this issue by creating a machine learning model capable of predicting flight prices. By leveraging Python and various libraries, including scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we have developed a predictive model to make travel planning easier and more cost-effective.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python
- scikit-learn/sklearn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter/Spyder/PyCharm (or any Python IDE of your choice)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Overview

In this project, we've undertaken the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: We acquired a dataset containing information about various flights, including departure and arrival locations, airline carriers, dates, and prices.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: To prepare the data for modeling, we performed data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

3. **Data Splitting**: We divided the dataset into dependent variables (the flight prices) and independent variables (features such as airline, date, route, etc.).

4. **Model Building**: Utilizing the scikit-learn library, we created a predictive model that takes the independent variables as inputs and predicts flight prices.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: To enhance the model's accuracy, we conducted hyperparameter tuning, optimizing the model's parameters for better performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluated the model using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to ensure its reliability.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains a wide range of flight-related information. It includes details about airlines, routes, departure/arrival cities, departure/arrival times, stops, and most importantly, flight prices. This dataset is crucial for training and testing our flight price prediction model.

## Methodology

Our methodology involves extracting the dependent and independent variables from the dataset, splitting the data into shuffled sets using stratified shuffle split from the scikit-learn library, and employing hyperparameter tuning to increase the accuracy of flight price predictions. This iterative process allows us to fine-tune our model and improve its predictive capabilities.

## Usage

You can clone this repository and explore the code and Jupyter notebooks to understand the implementation details. Additionally, you can use the model to predict flight prices based on your own dataset or real-world flight data.
